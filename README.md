# Digital Hygrometer V2 #

This repository contains source files for the second version of the digital hygrometer project.  This version implements dual sensors in which the readings from both sensors are compared prior to reporting the reading to the user.  

### TOOL SUITE ###

The source files are to be compiled using the XC 8 compiler **V2.0**.  The IDE used at the time of development was MPLAB X **v5.10**.  The resultant .hex file is to be deployed on the PIC18F66K22 MCU.  

### RELEASE NOTES ###
